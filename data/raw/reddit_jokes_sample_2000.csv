182800,Baseball & Football -George Carlin,"Baseball is different from any other sport, very different. For instance, in most sports you score points or goals; in baseball you score runs. In most sports the ball, or object, is put in play by the offensive team; in baseball the defensive team puts the ball in play, and only the defense is allowed to touch the ball. In fact, in baseball if an offensive player touches the ball intentionally, he's out; sometimes unintentionally, he's out.


Also: in football,basketball, soccer, volleyball, and all sports played with a ball, you score with the ball and in baseball the ball prevents you from scoring.


In most sports the team is run by a coach; in baseball the team is run by a manager. And only in baseball does the manager or coach wear the same clothing the players do. If you'd ever seen John Madden in his Oakland Raiders uniform,you'd know the reason for this custom.

Now, I've mentioned football. Baseball & football are the two most popular spectator sports in this country. And as such, it seems they ought to be able to tell us something about ourselves and our values.

I enjoy comparing baseball and football:


Baseball is a nineteenth-century pastoral game.
Football is a twentieth-century technological struggle.


Baseball is played on a diamond, in a park.The baseball park!
Football is played on a gridiron, in a stadium, sometimes called Soldier Field or War Memorial Stadium.


Baseball begins in the spring, the season of new life.
Football begins in the fall, when everything's dying.


In football you wear a helmet.
In baseball you wear a cap.


Football is concerned with downs - what down is it?
Baseball is concerned with ups - who's up?


In football you receive a penalty.
In baseball you make an error.


In football the specialist comes in to kick.
In baseball the specialist comes in to relieve somebody.


Football has hitting, clipping, spearing, piling on, personal fouls, late hitting and unnecessary roughness.
Baseball has the sacrifice.


Football is played in any kind of weather: rain, snow, sleet, hail, fog...
In baseball, if it rains, we don't go out to play.


Baseball has the seventh inning stretch.
Football has the two minute warning.


Baseball has no time limit: we don't know when it's gonna end - might have extra innings.
Football is rigidly timed, and it will end even if we've got to go to sudden death.


In baseball, during the game, in the stands, there's kind of a picnic feeling; emotions may run high or low, but there's not too much unpleasantness.
In football, during the game in the stands, you can be sure that at least twenty-seven times you're capable of taking the life of a fellow human being.


And finally, the objectives of the two games are completely different:


In football the object is for the quarterback, also known as the field general, to be on target with his aerial assault, riddling the defense by hitting his receivers with deadly accuracy in spite of the blitz, even if he has to use shotgun. With short bullet passes and long bombs, he marches his troops into enemy territory, balancing this aerial assault with a sustained ground attack that punches holes in the forward wall of the enemy's defensive line.

Inside, the dog jumped up on a chair and stared at the manager expectantly. The manager said, ""I can't hire you. The sign says you must be able to type.""

62287,A Girl I Knew in Class was a total Attention Whore,"A girl I knew in class was a total attention whore.

Never arrived to class on time and always made sure to make a huge fuss about it.

Didn't talk to her all that much, but I had a few conversations with her.

Her wrists had cuts and burns all over them. She wore t-shirts so she never hid them.

I asked her why she would hurt herself like that.

She said ""No one loves me and my life is painful"" etc., etc.

""No one loves you? What about your parents or your boyfriend?""

Answer she gave me was something like ""They actually don't love me,"" or some shit like that.

Made a point to not interact with her too much after that, because she's too much of an attention whore.

End of the school year, she came up to me and asked if I wanted to go somewhere with her that Sunday.

I'm not good with these situations, so I couldn't say no, even though I didn't like her.

Sunday came, and we went to one of those tower car parks.

Just as we got to the top, she told me that she wanted me to be here as a witness for her suicide.

""Oh shit,"" I thought. She was going to jump and was forcing me to watch!

Had I known that she was going to do this, I wouldn't have gone with her.

""Not watching unless you do a flip."" I said that to try and shock her into realizing this was stupid.

Complete shock was written all over her face. She thought I'd try and stop her.

""E-eh? You're not going to stop me?""

""No, go on ahead. If you really wanted to live, you'd stop yourself.""
After a while, she got off the ledge.

And then she walked up to me and tried to hug me with tears in her eyes, but I told her I loved someone else.

""Are you sure?"" asks the representative on the phone. ""This is our most rigorous program."" ""Absolutely,"" he replies, ""I haven't felt this good in years.""

The next day there's a knock at the door; and when he opens it he finds a huge muscular guy standing there wearing nothing but pink running shoes and a sign around his neck that reads, ""If I catch you, you are mine.""

He lost 33 lbs that week."

108734,I didn't get this joke ? please help,"A young man is sentenced to fifteen years
in prison. The warden
takes a liking to him and puts him in a cell
with a kindly oldtimer
so that he can be shown the ropes and not
get himself in trouble.

So the oldtimer teachs the youngster the
rules of the prison, what
to do, what not to do, stuff like that. One
of the rules he learns
is that there is no talking allowed during
meals.

A curious thing happens during meals
though and the young prisoner
is a bit confused. In the large mess hall,
once everyone is seated,
one of the prisoners stands up and loudly
says, ""47."" Everyone
in the hall laughs hysterically. A few
minutes later, another
prisoner stands up and loudly says, ""19.""
Again, a torrent of
laughter from everyone. This goes on
throughout the meal.

Later, when the youngster and the
oldtimer get back to their cell,
the young man asks, ""What was going in
the mess hall tonight? I
thought you said there was no talking
allowed.""
""Ah, yes, the mess hall. Well years ago,
the warden eased up on
that rule a bit, the one that disallows
talking at meals. You see,

number, and, because we have all of the
stories memorized, it's

The young inmate nods understandingly
and falls off to sleep.

After a few weeks of this mealtime
behavior, the young man gets
up a bit of nerve and decides to tell a
story.

So, one evening at the dinner meal, he
stands up and loudly says,
""26."" No one laughs. Not even a twitter.
So he tries again, ""26.""
Still nothing. He sits down sheepishly and
embarrassed.

Later, he pleads with the oldtimer to
explain what happened.
""That is such a good story, number 26, how
come no one laughed.""
The old man turned to him and explained,
""It's the way you told it.""
","Joke: I didn't get this joke ? please help,  Punchline: A young man is sentenced to fifteen years
in prison. The warden
takes a liking to him and puts him in a cell
with a kindly oldtimer
so that he can be shown the ropes and not
get himself in trouble.

So the oldtimer teachs the youngster the
rules of the prison, what
to do, what not to do, stuff like that. One
of the rules he learns
is that there is no talking allowed during
meals.

A curious thing happens during meals
though and the young prisoner
is a bit confused. In the large mess hall,
once everyone is seated,
one of the prisoners stands up and loudly
says, ""47."" Everyone
in the hall laughs hysterically. A few
minutes later, another
prisoner stands up and loudly says, ""19.""
Again, a torrent of
laughter from everyone. This goes on
throughout the meal.

Later, when the youngster and the
oldtimer get back to their cell,
the young man asks, ""What was going in
the mess hall tonight? I
thought you said there was no talking
allowed.""
""Ah, yes, the mess hall. Well years ago,
the warden eased up on
that rule a bit, the one that disallows
talking at meals. You see,
all of us inmates have memorized a long
list of jokes and stories
by the number, so that all one of us has to
do is call out its
number, and, because we have all of the
stories memorized, it's
like someone told the whole funny story.""

So he went to a studio to get his commercial made. There he gave an idea of how he wanted his commercial ""I want it to be epic and persuasive, everyone should buy my nails"", he was said to not worry and come back in a week, and the commercial would be made. He came back a week later and he watched his commercial preview.

The scene was grim and dark, unsettling holy music was filling the air and Bob could see a ghastly figure moaning and suffering in the distance. The camera slowly got closer to the mysterious figure. It was Jesus at the cross, having his final moments and making pain noises. Then, the commercial tag came in ""Bob's Nails. Never fails.""

Bob was visibly angry. ""This is outrageous! Preposterous! You will get me in so much trouble if this runs on the TV"". The commercial editor and director had no idea what was wrong with it, but fearing his client would refuse to pay, he asked for a second chance. Bob had to think for a moment, but thinking that it possibly couldn't be worse, agreed. He was there a week later and a new commercial was waiting for him.

The scene this time was a vibrant read and you could see a small field, tension was rising and the music was sharp and nerve wrecking. Suddenly, a man in poor shape came running through the field, wearing teared clothes and had scratches and cuts dripping blood all over his body. Not that far behind him, a huge army of roman soldiers were rushing hot on his trail. We see the man and the soldiers passing the camera and two soldiers are left behind, gasping for breath. 

One looks at the other and slaps his arm.

109574,No Bell Peace Prize,"John was in the fertilized egg business. 

He had several hundred young layers (hens), called 'pullets,' and ten roosters to fertilize the eggs. 

He kept records, and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced. 
Keeping track of the roosters took a lot of time, so he bought some tiny bells and attached them to his roosters.

Each bell had a different tone, so he could tell from a distance, which rooster was performing. 
He just sat on his porch and filled out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells. 
John's favorite rooster, old Butch, was a very fine specimen, but this morning he noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! 

When he went to investigate, he saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets, hearing the roosters coming, ran for cover. 

To John's amazement, old Butch kept his bell in his beak, so it didn't ring. 
Butch would sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the next one. 

John was so proud of old Butch, he entered him in the County Fair and he became an overnight sensation 
among the judges. 

The result was the judges not only awarded old Butch the No Bell Piece Prize but they also awarded him the Pulletsurprise as well. 

Clearly old Butch was a politician in the making. 

Who else but a politician could figure out how to win two of the most highly coveted awards on our planet by being the best at sneaking up on the populace and screwing them WHEN THEY WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION! 

Vote carefully next year, the bells are not always audible.","Joke: No Bell Peace Prize,  Punchline: John was in the fertilized egg business.

There were individual encampments dotting the planet, all of which were surrounded by 100 foot high concrete walls. If you looked hard enough, you could see that there were cracks all over the walls, from previous failed attempts at escape.

Fue was a brilliant boy, and studied mechanical engineering his whole life, so that one day he could taste the sweetness of victory. Fue was able to feed his insatiable desire to escape by working in the scrapyard near his small hut in the encampment. He spent years on a secret project that he knew would one day lead him to freedom. After 10 years of hard work, Fue lancaster finished his project, a remarkable, and heavily armed jet fighter. He proudly looked upon his creation and decided he should name it after himself. It wasn't long after that fue took flight, and headed towards the wall. With the press of a small red button, the roaring of the flight engines on the missiles could be heard for miles. With the loudest boom fue  had ever heard, he saw the wall crumble. He felt a new sensation in his face and realized that he was smiling for the first time. That smile soon faded when fue realized that the center of the wall was made of solid steel! With a mighty yawp, fue blasted roaring flames at the treacherous metal keeping him from his one desire of freedom. His yell did not stop until there was no more fire left. His heart raced as he waited for the smoke to clear. All of a sudden, his heart broke into a million pieces, and it was in that moment, that he realized, that Jet Fue L can't melt steel beams","Joke: The Plight of Fue Lancaster,  Punchline: The year is 2652, on a faraway planet meant for prisoners of a far ranging galactic war.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.
He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

159633,My 40th birthday,"This is a true story. Last week was my 40th birthday and I really didn’t feel like waking up that morning. I managed to pull myself together and go downstairs for breakfast, hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, “Happy Birthday!”, and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone “Happy Birthday.” I thought… Well, that’s marriage for you, but the kids… They will remember.

My kids came trampling down the stairs to breakfast, ate their breakfast, and didn’t say a word to me. So when I made it out of the house and started for work, I felt pretty dumpy and despondent.

As I walked into my office, my secretary Joanne said, “Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!” It felt a bit better knowing that at least someone remembered. I worked in a zombie like fashion until about one o’clock, when Joanne knocked on my door and said, “You know, it’s such a beautiful day outside, and it’s your Birthday, why don’t we go out for lunch, just you and me.” I said, “Thanks, Joanne, that’s the best thing I’ve heard all day. Let’s go!”

We went to lunch but not where we’d normally go. Instead she took me to a quiet bistro with a private table. We had a couple of mixed drinks and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. On the way back to the office, Joanne said, “You know, It’s such a beautiful day… We don’t have to go right back to the office, do we?” I replied with “I suppose not. What do you have in mind?” She said, “Let’s go to my apartment, it’s just around the corner.”

After arriving at her apartment, Joanne turned to me and said, “Boss if you don’t mind, I’m goinna to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I’ll be right back.” “Ok.” I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake…

Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends, and co-workers, all singing “Happy Birthday”.

And I just sat there…

On the couch…

Chicken: 'Sorry. Has anyone seen a tomato family walking around here? Sorry to bother you. Sorry.'

Scientist 1: 'Sure. They were across the street about ten minutes ago heading north. If you hurry you'll ketchup.'

Chicken: 'Sorry. Thanks. Sorry again. I have to go now. Sorry.'

Scientist 2: 'What's his deal?'

Horse: 'He's Canadian. Good guy.'

A screeching sound comes from outside followed by the unmistakable sound of a bus hitting a chicken.

*In heaven

St Peter: 'Look chicken, it's been a busy century, I've been whizzing round trying to find priests and lawyers for some young couple, some idiot just got in, the devil nabbed our only engineer, and to top it off some nuns have just been washing various body parts in the holy bowl. Do you mind waiting?'

Chicken: 'Yeah, no. Super sorry about all that. I'll just head down these stairs and go to hell so you can have a better morning. Sorry again. B-bye.'

St.Peter : 'Thanks man.'

The chicken heads for the stairs...

St.Peter: 'Next. Name and manner of death.'

Next in line: 'Harambe. I dunno what happened man. I was trying hug this kid who tried to jump me and the next thing I know I'm stood behind that chicken and that guy who died in the refridgerator.'

St. Peter: 'Ok, let me just check your lie clock.....'

73611,Zookeeper's helper,"A small zoo in Mississippi obtained a very rare species of gorilla. Within a few weeks the gorilla, a female, became very difficult to handle.
Upon examination, the veterinarian determined the problem. The gorilla was in heat. To make matters worse, there was no male gorilla available. 
Thinking about their problem, the zookeeper thought of Ed-Lee Walton, a redneck part-time worker responsible for cleaning the animal cages. Ed-Lee had little sense, but possessed ample ability to satisfy a female of any species. The Zoo Keeper thought they might have a solution. Ed-Lee was approached with a proposition. Would he be
willing to mate with the gorilla for $500?  Ed-Lee showed some interest, but said he would have to think the matter over carefully. The following day, he announced that he would accept their offer, but only under five conditions:
""First"", Ed-Lee said, ""I ain't gonna kiss her on the lips."" 
The zookeeper quickly agreed.
""Second"", he said, ""She must wear a 'Dale Earnhardt Forever' T-Shirt.""
The keeper again readily agreed to this condition.
""Third"", he said, ""You can't never tell no one about this.""
The keeper again readily agreed.
""Fourth"", Ed-Lee said, ""I want all the children raised Southern Baptist.""
Once again it was agreed.
""And last,"" Ed-Lee said, ""I'll need another week to come up with the $500.""","Joke: Zookeeper's helper,  Punchline: A small zoo in Mississippi obtained a very rare species of gorilla. Within a few weeks the gorilla, a female, became very difficult to handle.
